# My ESPHome Scripts

***Note: This work is in progress!***

## Warning!

This example code is supplied **"as is"** with no warranties of any kind, it works on my setup but it does not mean it will work on yours without modifications or at all. This example is meant to point you in the right direction. I take no responsibilities on it's usage. 
I've tried to document it sufficiently that it is readable and easy to understand.

## Content
This is a collection of ESPHome YAML scripts I use, each project has its own folder, please read the readme file in those folders for more information of that project.
